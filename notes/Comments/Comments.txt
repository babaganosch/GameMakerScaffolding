TODOs and ideas..

For object culling, extend the camera with a feature to calculate the size buffer info.
This should be calculated based on the velocity of the camera:
(Example: camera moving to the right)
[ .. ]
  [ ..  ]
      [ ..   ]
        [ ..  ]
        [ .. ]
Drawback of this however could be activation of objects and directly deactivating them
again due to buffer shrinking when slowing down


Engine could be extended with a lightweight state machine

Terminal should probably be reworked from scratch
